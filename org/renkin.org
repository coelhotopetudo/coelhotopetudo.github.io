[MHXX] Renkin/Alchemy short summary

The terms Alchemy and Renkin are used interchangebly.

* SP

Renkin can achieve 4 levels of SP (Style Powerup).

All hunting styles have access to SP 1 and can only set 1 HA to SPHA.
While Renkin can go up to SP4, and Renkin can set all 3 HA to SPHA.

According to the [[http://www.capcom.co.jp/monsterhunter/XX/action/main/03.html][official page]]

-  *SP 1 (Yellow)* Power up each style differently

-  *SP 2 (Orange)* 1 + Stamina gauge takes longer to reduce its max size

-  *SP 3 (Red)* 1 + 2 + auto health regen

-  *SP 4 (Purple)* 1 + 2 + 3 + More stagger (I think)

And HA set to use SP will charge slower (by [[/u/Ivalia]])

* Renkin & SP

When you transmute different items, you will upgrade your SP level; but
it will not replace your current SP, not until you reactivate another
SPHA. For example, currently I have SP2 active, I transmute an item with
my renkin barrel and gain SP3, all my SPHA will switch from orange
highlights to red highlights, but my SP2 remains active. SP3 will
activated whenever I activated the red SPHA.

Many thanks to [[/u/ivalia]] for figuring out the mechanics. You need to
spent a certain amount of gauge to upgrade your SP.

| Total Gauge spent   | Sp level gain   |
|---------------------+-----------------|
| 2                   | 2               |
| 5                   | 3               |
| 12                  | 4               |

My test cases (referring to the item table below, 3A is level 3
transmutation with A button)

-  3A (SP2) + 1A + 1A (SP3) + 2X + 3X + 3A (SP4)

-  3A (SP2) + 2X (SP3) + 5X + 1A + 1X (SP4)

-  2X (SP2) + 3A(SP3)

-  A+A will give you a side slash + strong charge slash finisher (but I
   don't think it will have the MV or power of the regular version

-  A for fade slash

-  R for spirit combo, you cannot sneak in X or A for additional attacks

-  No fade slash -> spirit

*Sword and Shield*

-  No backhop

-  Basically Striker, with 1 or 2 missing move, but the combo tree is
   pretty much still intact

   scissor slash.
